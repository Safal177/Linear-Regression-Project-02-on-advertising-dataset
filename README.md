# Linear regression and ridge regression project
In this project, “Advertising.csv” dataset downloaded from “An Introduction to Statistical Learning” was analyzed using linear regression, and ridge regression in Python. I show my main skills in data preprocessing, model selecting, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating model performance. 
# Project keys:
•	Predict sales on advertising budget with TV, radio, and newspaper.
•	Dataset (Advertising.csv) downloaded from “An Introduction to Statistical Learning
with Applications in R”.
•	Use “StandardScaler” for data processing
•	Use train-test split and then validation split to minimize data leakage.
•	Use ridge regression from scikit-learn.
•	Adjust “alpha” parameter for tuning.
•	Test model with “mean squared error”
•	Use cross-validation for this model
# Tools:
•	Python
•	Pandas, 
•	NumPy
•	 Data preprocessing,
•	scikit-learn
•	Regression modeling
•	Scaling
•	cross-validation
# Project Files 
•	“Python_Machine_Learning_Linear_Regression_project_02.pdf”. It includes Python code and results.
